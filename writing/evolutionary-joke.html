                <p>Yet another post related to Australia.</p>

                <p>The deadliest spider on earth, Sydney Funnel Web (by the way, I love it, it's so fascinating! I might want to write another post just about this spider. In the meantime, check out <a href="https://inchem.org/documents/pims/animal/atrax.htm">this</a> link! No pictures, I promise…)</p>

                <p>Anyway, the deadliest spider on earth (deadliest to humans) evolved when there were no humans or primates around. Because there are no primates in Australia… duh. Ironically, its venom is the most potent for guess who? Right, for exactly this group - primates! These are the species that have the most severe allergic reaction to the venom if you will. To keep it short, most species deliver different protein molecules some of which can be hemotoxins or neurotoxins. The <code>-toxins</code> part hints at it being dangerous. Basically, you die of suffocation because you can't breathe. For someone who is a neuro nerd as I am: the reason is that the venom has <code>delta-hexatoxin</code> (<code>Delta-hexatoxin-Ar1a</code> to be specific, and check <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01478">this</a> out as well) which inhibits the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels. This causes the cells to remain in an excited state for longer, causing respiratory depression and circulatory failure resulting in death. You can read more about the mechanisms in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/40/24920">this</a> research paper.</p>

                <p>The venom has to get into your bloodstream to have an effect though. Thus, for example, drinking the venom would be safe! Let me end this post on this positive note... :)</p>
