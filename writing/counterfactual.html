                <p>The consequences of an action should be evaluated relative to what would have happened if the action were not taken — the counterfactual.</p>

                <p>Consider a first aid scenario. If you assist an injured person on the street, your direct impact is the help provided. However, the counterfactual impact depends on whether someone better qualified would have stepped in otherwise.</p>

                <p>It's possible to have a negative counterfactual impact while having a positive tangible impact.</p>

                <p>This raises an important question: when direct positive outcomes conflict with what might have happened in your absence, which measure better reflects genuine value creation?</p>
